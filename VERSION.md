# Project Version and Release Notes

## Current Version: v1.1.1

### v1.1.1 - USS Salt Availability Fix (February 2026)

#### Critical Bug Fix: Machine-ID in Initramfs

**Problem**: USS derivation was failing at boot because `/etc/machine-id` (used as salt) was not available in initramfs, causing different USS to be derived during setup vs. boot.

**Impact**: LUKS unlock would fail with "Key derived successfully" but "Failed to unlock LUKS device" because the derived USS (and thus CDI and LUKS key) didn't match.

#### 🔧 Fixes

**Initramfs Hook:**
- Added machine-id copy to initramfs in `initramfs-hooks/hooks/tkey-luks`
- Ensures consistent salt availability between setup and boot
- Added verification message: "✓ Copied machine-id for USS derivation"

**Testing:**
- Fixed `test/test-improved-uss.sh` to find client in multiple locations
- Added `test/verify-salt-availability.sh` to verify salt consistency

**Documentation:**
- Added `docs/IMPROVED-USS-FIX.md` with complete troubleshooting guide
- Explains root cause, fix, verification, and migration steps

#### ⚠️ Required Actions After Update

1. **Rebuild initramfs** to include machine-id:
   ```bash
   sudo update-initramfs -u -k all
   ```

2. **Verify salt availability**:
   ```bash
   cd test && bash verify-salt-availability.sh
   ```

3. **Re-add LUKS keys** (old keys used wrong USS):
   ```bash
   cd test/luks-setup
   ./add-tkey-key.sh /dev/sdXY your-password
   ```

#### 📝 Technical Details

**Root Cause:**
- Setup: Reads `/etc/machine-id` from host → derives USS₁
- Boot: `/etc/machine-id` unavailable in initramfs → derives USS₂
- Result: USS₁ ≠ USS₂ → Wrong CDI → Wrong LUKS key → Unlock fails

**Solution:**
- Copy `/etc/machine-id` into initramfs during `update-initramfs`
- Both setup and boot now use same salt → same USS → same key → unlock succeeds

**Security**: Including machine-id in initramfs is safe as it's not a secret (world-readable on host system). Real security comes from: password + TKey hardware + UDS + physical touch.

#### 📦 Files Changed

- `initramfs-hooks/hooks/tkey-luks` - Added machine-id copy
- `test/test-improved-uss.sh` - Fixed client path detection
- `test/verify-salt-availability.sh` - NEW: Verification tool
- `docs/IMPROVED-USS-FIX.md` - NEW: Complete fix documentation

### v1.1.0 - Improved USS Derivation (January 2025)

#### Major Security Enhancement: Password-Based USS Derivation

This release introduces a significant security improvement by eliminating USS file storage and implementing password-based USS derivation using PBKDF2.

#### 🔒 Security Improvements

- **No USS Files**: USS is now derived from password at boot time (never stored on disk)
- **PBKDF2-HMAC-SHA256**: Strong key derivation with 100,000 iterations (configurable)
- **System-Unique**: Machine-id used as salt for system-specific key derivation
- **Double Password Protection**: Password used in both USS derivation and BLAKE2b challenge
- **Attack Resistance**: Eliminates USS extraction attacks from boot partition

#### ✨ New Features

**Client Application:**

- Added `--derive-uss` flag for improved USS derivation mode
- Added `--uss-password` and `--uss-password-stdin` flags for password input
- Added `--salt` flag for custom salt (defaults to machine-id)
- Added `--pbkdf2-iterations` flag (default: 100,000)
- Deprecated `--uss PATH` with migration warnings
- Automatic system salt detection (machine-id → dbus machine-id → DMI UUID → hostname)

**Initramfs Integration:**

- Updated `00-tkey-luks` script to use `--derive-uss` automatically
- Password entry at boot derives USS dynamically
- No changes to `/etc/crypttab` required (still needs `initramfs` option)

**Documentation:**

- New comprehensive security guide: `docs/SECURITY.md` (includes USS derivation)
- Updated `docs/SETUP.md` with improved enrollment instructions
- Updated `docs/SECURITY.md` with new security model analysis
- Migration guide from v1.0.x file-based USS

**Testing:**

- New test script: `test/test-uss-derivation.sh` (USS derivation unit tests)
- New test script: `test/test-improved-uss.sh` (hardware validation)
- Updated `test/luks-setup/*.sh` scripts for improved USS
- All tests pass on real hardware (TKey at /dev/ttyACM0)

**Packaging:**

- Complete Debian packaging (`debian/` directory)
- GitHub Actions workflow for automated releases (`.github/workflows/release.yml`)
- Automated Debian package building on version tags
- CI/CD integration with package testing

#### 🔄 Migration from v1.0.x

If you're using file-based USS (v1.0.x):

1. Enroll with improved USS derivation (new keyslot):

   ```bash
   echo "password" | sudo tkey-luks-client --derive-uss \
     --challenge-from-stdin --output - | \
   sudo cryptsetup luksAddKey /dev/sdXY -
   ```

2. Update initramfs and test boot:

   ```bash
   sudo update-initramfs -u
   sudo reboot
   ```

3. After confirming boot works, remove old keyslot:

   ```bash
   sudo cryptsetup luksKillSlot /dev/sdXY <old-slot-number>
   ```

4. Delete old USS files:

   ```bash
   sudo rm -rf /boot/initramfs-uss/
   ```

#### ⚠️ Breaking Changes

**None** - Full backward compatibility maintained:

- Old `--uss PATH` flag still works (with deprecation warning)
- Existing enrolled keys continue to function
- Initramfs scripts support both old and new methods

#### 📊 Technical Details

**USS Derivation Formula:**

```text
USS = PBKDF2-HMAC-SHA256(
  password = user_password,
  salt = machine-id,
  iterations = 100000,
  length = 32 bytes
)
```

**Full Cryptographic Flow:**

1. Client derives USS from password using PBKDF2
2. TKey generates CDI: `CDI = Hash(UDS ⊕ App ⊕ USS)`
3. Device app derives Ed25519 key from CDI
4. Device app computes: `LUKS_key = BLAKE2b(key=secret_key, data=password)`

**Security Properties:**

- Password used in **two independent layers** (USS + BLAKE2b)
- USS never exposed to filesystem or network
- Device-unique via UDS (unextractable hardware secret)
- System-unique via machine-id salt
- Strong KDF prevents brute-force (100k iterations)
- Physical touch required (prevents automation)

#### 🏗️ Build System Changes

- Updated `client/Makefile` (no changes required)
- Updated `debian/rules` for package building
- Added `golang.org/x/crypto/pbkdf2` dependency
- Go 1.21+ required (for crypto libraries)

#### 📝 Files Changed

**Core Implementation:**

- `client/main.go` - Added USS derivation functions
- `initramfs-hooks/scripts/local-top/00-tkey-luks` - Added --derive-uss flag

- `docs/SETUP.md` - Updated with improved enrollment
- `docs/SECURITY.md` - Updated security model analysis
