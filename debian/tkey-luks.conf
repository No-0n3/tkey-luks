# TKey-LUKS Configuration File
# This file is reserved for future use. Currently no configuration needed.
# USS derivation uses system defaults (machine-id salt, 100k PBKDF2 iterations).

# Future configuration options may include:
# - Custom PBKDF2 iteration count
# - Alternative salt sources
# - USS derivation algorithm selection
# - Boot-time unlock behavior
# - Debug logging levels

# For current configuration options, see:
# - /usr/share/doc/tkey-luks/SETUP.md
# - /usr/share/doc/tkey-luks/USS-DERIVATION.md
